# OnStellar Client Contributing Guide

### :computer: Dev Setup
The steps are as follows:
- If you are part of the OnStellar team then clone directly from the organization's repo: `git clone https://github.com/OnStellar/client.git`, otherwise, fork the repo and clone from there: `git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/client.git`
- `cd` into the newly cloned `client` and run `yarn` to download dependencies
- Run `yarn serve` to start a local server at `http://localhost:8080`

**If you encountered any errors trying to get the client setup locally, please open an issue and we will get back to you as soon as we can!**
